Overview
This project performs survival analysis on the RADCURE dataset using various techniques:

Kaplan-Meier curves for estimating survival probability over time.
Cox Proportional Hazards model for evaluating the impact of different variables on survival.
Random Survival Forests (RSF) for predicting survival and identifying important features.

Usage
Kaplan-Meier Analysis: Plot survival curves based on tumor stage and treatment modality.
Cox Proportional Hazards Model: Fit the model and check for proportional hazards assumptions.
Random Survival Forests (RSF): Train the model, analyze feature importance, and calculate the C-index.
